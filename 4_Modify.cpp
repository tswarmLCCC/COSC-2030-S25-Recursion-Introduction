Problem Description:
We have three towers (letâ€™s call them A, B, and C) and a set of N disks.
The disks are initially stacked on tower A in decreasing order of size (largest at the bottom, smallest at the top).
The goal is to move all the disks from tower A to tower C, following these rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty tower.
